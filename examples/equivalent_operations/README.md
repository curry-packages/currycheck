This directory contains some examples for the use
of CurryCheck to check the equivalence of operations.

Since most of these are examples to test whether CurryCheck
is able to report counter-examples, their test fails intentionally.
These are the programs
- Ints12 (generators for infinite lists)
- NDInsert (non-deterministic list insertion)
- RevRev (double reverse)
- SimpleExample
- SortEquiv (two variants of permutation sort)
- Take (two variants of take)

The following programs contain successful equivalence tests:
- Fac (recursive specification of factorial vs. iterative implementation)
- SelectionSort
- SortISortEquiv
